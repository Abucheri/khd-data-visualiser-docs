# Kisumu Health Department Data Visualisation Tool

The Kisumu Health Department Data Visualisation Tool is a web based application that
can be used to generate charts of indicators from DHIS2. In addition, charts can also 
be generated manually without the use of DHIS2 to form custom charts that can be printed and
presented.

This repository is majorly the documentation on how to use the application.
